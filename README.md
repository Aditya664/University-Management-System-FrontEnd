To include images:

1. Make sure you have a `screenshots` folder (or any name you prefer) in your project directory where you store your screenshots.

2. Replace `image.png` and `/screenshots/screenshot2.png` with the relative paths to your actual image files. You can use any image format such as PNG or JPEG.

3. Provide a description for each image to explain what it depicts.

4. Update the rest of the README with relevant information about your project.

When someone views your README on platforms like GitHub, it will automatically render the images, and users can click on them to view them in full size.
